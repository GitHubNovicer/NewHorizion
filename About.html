        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Parker Alexander</h2>
<p>I thought I'd make it personal and talk
    about myself a little bit. I am solid
    in my belief about Jesus and the Bible being true.
    I love talking to God day in and day out about
    my troubles and mistakes, successes and challenges.
    God inhabits our praise.
    Praise be to Jesus the Most High King.
</p>
<p>
    In my early years of faith, I definitely struggled
    more with sinning, but sin diminishes as you grow.
    I still battle with anxiety and fear when I do fall,
    but I turn to Jesus in faith for the forgiveness of
    my sin. Repent! I turn away from sin unto God; sometimes
    my repentance is short lived other times its stands
    the test of time. He comforts me in my brokeness and 
    leads me by still waters.
